## [0.1.0-SNAPSHOT] - 2025-04-23
Still regex at heart, just with eggs-tra yolk in the shell.

### Changed
- Renamed several classes to align with **redeggs** branding:
  - `RegularExpression` â†’ `RegularEggspression`
  - `RecursiveDescentRegexParser` â†’ `RecursiveDescentRedeggsParser`
  - `RegexParseException` â†’ `RedeggsParseException`
- While the core regex functionality remains unchanged, the names now crack with a bit more personality. ðŸ¥š
